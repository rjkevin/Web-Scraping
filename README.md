# Introduction 
In the absences of an API, web scraping is used to extract data from a website. This basic web scraper allows me to extract and compile  a list of outbound leads consisting of restaurants under the Marriot Bonvoy Hotels. After scraping the data, I proceeded to trim whitespaces and upload the scraped data into a data frame using the pandas library.
